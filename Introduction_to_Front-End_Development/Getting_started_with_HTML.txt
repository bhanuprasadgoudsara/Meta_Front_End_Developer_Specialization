WHAT IS HTML ?
HTML: HyperText Markup Language
HyperText: The Text which contains links to other text.
MarkUp: Tags and Elemnts used within a document
Extension: .html
HTML is text file with specific structure that consists of  different components such as tags and elements and describe to the webpage what to display.

Difference between HTML Tags and HTML Elements:
Each HTML element consists of an opening tag enclosed in angled brackets (Ex: <p>). most elements paired with a closing tag which has a forward slash off to the left angle bracket(Ex: </p>). 

HTML usually have content inside them.
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
       index.html: This is a paragraph 

HTML elements can also contains other elements.
Ex:     HTML synax: 
          <p>
              This is a <i>paragraph</i>
          </p>
        index.html: This is a paragraph(italic)

You want to insert a paragraph on your website. Choose the correct format for the opening and closing paragraph tags:      
- Opening tag: <p/> Closing tag: </p> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p>
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p/> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: </p> - Correct

Elements can also be empty or self-closing (do not have closing HTML tag)
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a <br>paragraph</p> (line break tag)
       index.html: This is a 
                   paragraph  
At the end of self-closing tag, you can close the right angle bracket by '/' like this '<br/>'

HTML standards:
HTML specification: The rules and structure for elements and tags.
The HTML specification is maintained by the "World Wide Web Consortium" (W3C).
Whenever the HTML specification changes, a new version of HTML is standardized.
The current version is 'HTML 5'.

HTML syntax: <img src="icon.png"/>


HTML DOCUMENTS: A text document containing simple webpage formatting. We dont need the web to view the HTML document. They don't have to be hosted on a web server for you to view them in your web browser. You can save HTML files on your computer and viewed them locally with your web browser. 

Here we are creating a very simple webpage for restaurant called 'Little Lemon'.
To create a HTML file and Visual Studio Code. Right-click in the 'Explorer' panel and select 'New File'. I'll name it index.html. 
- But before I can add elements or tags, I first need to create a standard HTML structure which starts with the DOCTYPE declaration. This notifies the web browser that is a HTML documents. 
- Next, I create the HTML tag, which is also known as the 'HTML root element'. 
- Inside the HTML tag, I add two main elements. The 'head' and the 'body' elements. 
- Is important to note that nothing inside the head element is displayed on the webpage in the web browser. In the head element, you add information or metadata about the HTML documents. It is not part of the content of the webpage. For example, inside the head tag, you always create the 'title' elements. This is the title that is displayed in the web browser tab. I can also link to CSS files and define Meta tags in the 'head section'. Meta tags can, for instance, specify the description of the web page, keywords for search engines and the order of the web page. 
- Next up, I add the content of the webpage inside the body tag. 
- The body can contain elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos. 

Procedure:
- Let me start by adding a main heading on the webpage by using the H1 tag. Inside the H1 tag, I typed the heading, Our Menu. That's good. Now I need to start creating my menu. I want to add two items. To do that, I add two subheadings. For this, I use the H2 tag. The menu items in the subheadings are falafel and pasta salad. 
- In order to make sure everything is correct, I open my index.html file in the browser to check my webpage. But first I need to save the file by pressing the keys Control and S or if you're on a Mac, Command and S. Now, I right-click on my index.html file in the explorer panel and select Reveal in File Explorer. If you're not using Windows, this may be called revealing finder or reveal in file browser. Now the file browser opens and lists the file. I double-click on index.html and it opens in the web browser. Great, it's all there. 
- The title that displays in the browser tab matches the title that I added to the head section and the content is displayed in the browser window but it is still a bit empty. I go back to Visual Studio Code and add a short description for each dish. I do this by adding a paragraph tag below each subheading H2.

SIMPL HTML TAGS:
There are many tags available in HTML. Here you will learn about common tags that you'll use as a developer.
Headings: allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.
Paragraphs: contain text content.
Note: Putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.
Line Breaks: As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.
Strong: Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.
Bold: Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.
Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important.
Emphasis: Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
Italics: Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.
Emphasis vs. Italics: By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. The only difference is the meaning. Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them. Italics represent off-set text and should be used for technical terms, titles, a thought or a phrase from another language. Screen readers will not announce any difference if an italics tag is used.
Lists: You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.
- Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag.
- Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag. Again, list items are specified using the <li> tag.
Div tags: A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS. It can be nested inside other elements. Div elements are an important part of building webpages.
Comments: The comment will not be displayed in the web browser. If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as: <!-- This is a comment -->  


LINKING DOCUMENTS:
- Websites consists of multiple webpages linked together. To link pages together, You use the 'anchor tag'. Anchor tag create hyperlinks(links). 
- In this video, you will learn how to link different web pages together to create your own website. In my project folder. I now create a second webpage for Little Lemon that will contain the address of the restaurants.

Q. You are creating a website and you want to add a link to the about.html page on your home.html page. What is the correct notation to create this link?   
- <a href = “about.html”>About</a> - Correct
- <a> about.html </a>
- <a> href = about.html </a> 
- <a href = “home.html”>About</a>

- I typed the file name, location.html so that my index.html file will link to it. Within a tag I can also add a descriptive text that is displayed as a link name on my web page. So I type our location. The text our location will now display on the web page in the browser as a clickable link. The words are location are displayed in blue by the web browser. If I click on the blue link, the browser opens the location.html file. You can now link different HTML files together to create your website.

ADDING IMAGES TO A WEBPAGE WITH HTML:              
A website without pictures wouldn't provide a very good user experience. 
how to add images to HTML documents using the image (IMG tag). 
- Similar to what I did with document links, I have to specify the link to the image file using the image tag. Images are not inserted into web pages. Instead we use image tags in HTML to link to image files. The image tag then creates a placeholder for the image on the web page. To add an image tag, I type img and inside it I add the src attribute or source attribute as it is known. I type falafel.jpeg As a source for one image, And salad.jpeg,

As a source for the other image. Let's save the file and open it in the web browser.

The images are displayed but they are way too big.

Luckily there are several ways to set the size of an image but in this video I will just demonstrate how to do this in HTML. Right after the sourcing in the image tag, you can specify the dimensions of an image. I first add the width attribute, And set it to 240 pixels. Then I add the height attribute and set it to 135 pixels. I'll set the other image to the same dimensions.

Let's save and view it in the browser again.

Much better, the images are smaller now. But there is one important attribute that you should always include with image tags. It is good practice to add a short description for images. It helps improve accessibility for people using assistive technologies and it can also improve search engine rankings. You can add image descriptions with the alternative text attribute also known as the altar tribute. Still within the image tag after the dimensions attributes you can add the altar tribute.

I will type a short description, A falafel and for the other image I will type, A pasta salad. I will save the Html file again and open it in the web browser.

The all text is not displayed anywhere on the site but will be read by assistive technologies such as screen readers. Screen readers and other accessibility tools use the altar tribute to provide information to their users. Now you know how to add images to websites with the image tag. Little Lemon website is now ready for everyone who uses the web. Have fun while you make your sites colorful by adding images
