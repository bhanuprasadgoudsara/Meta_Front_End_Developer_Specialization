WHAT IS HTML ?
HTML: HyperText Markup Language
HyperText: The Text which contains links to other text.
MarkUp: Tags and Elemnts used within a document
Extension: .html
HTML is text file with specific structure that consists of  different components such as tags and elements and describe to the webpage what to display.

Difference between HTML Tags and HTML Elements:
Each HTML element consists of an opening tag enclosed in angled brackets (Ex: <p>). most elements paired with a closing tag which has a forward slash off to the left angle bracket(Ex: </p>). 

HTML usually have content inside them.
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
       index.html: This is a paragraph 

HTML elements can also contains other elements.
Ex:     HTML synax: 
          <p>
              This is a <i>paragraph</i>
          </p>
        index.html: This is a paragraph(italic)

You want to insert a paragraph on your website. Choose the correct format for the opening and closing paragraph tags:      
- Opening tag: <p/> Closing tag: </p> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p>
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p/> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: </p> - Correct

Elements can also be empty or self-closing (do not have closing HTML tag)
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a <br>paragraph</p> (line break tag)
       index.html: This is a 
                   paragraph  
At the end of self-closing tag, you can close the right angle bracket by '/' like this '<br/>'

HTML standards:
HTML specification: The rules and structure for elements and tags.
The HTML specification is maintained by the "World Wide Web Consortium" (W3C).
Whenever the HTML specification changes, a new version of HTML is standardized.
The current version is 'HTML 5'.

HTML syntax: <img src="icon.png"/>


HTML DOCUMENTS: A text document containing simple webpage formatting. We dont need the web to view the HTML document. They don't have to be hosted on a web server for you to view them in your web browser. You can save HTML files on your computer and viewed them locally with your web browser. 

Here we are creating a very simple webpage for restaurant called 'Little Lemon'.
To create a HTML file and Visual Studio Code. Right-click in the 'Explorer' panel and select 'New File'. I'll name it index.html. 
- But before I can add elements or tags, I first need to create a standard HTML structure which starts with the DOCTYPE declaration. This notifies the web browser that is a HTML documents. 
- Next, I create the HTML tag, which is also known as the 'HTML root element'. 
- Inside the HTML tag, I add two main elements. The 'head' and the 'body' elements. 
- Is important to note that nothing inside the head element is displayed on the webpage in the web browser. In the head element, you add information or metadata about the HTML documents. It is not part of the content of the webpage. For example, inside the head tag, you always create the 'title' elements. This is the title that is displayed in the web browser tab. I can also link to CSS files and define Meta tags in the 'head section'. Meta tags can, for instance, specify the description of the web page, keywords for search engines and the order of the web page. 
- Next up, I add the content of the webpage inside the body tag. 
- The body can contain elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos. 

Procedure:
- Let me start by adding a main heading on the webpage by using the H1 tag. Inside the H1 tag, I typed the heading, Our Menu. That's good. Now I need to start creating my menu. I want to add two items. To do that, I add two subheadings. For this, I use the H2 tag. The menu items in the subheadings are falafel and pasta salad. 
- In order to make sure everything is correct, I open my index.html file in the browser to check my webpage. But first I need to save the file by pressing the keys Control and S or if you're on a Mac, Command and S. Now, I right-click on my index.html file in the explorer panel and select Reveal in File Explorer. If you're not using Windows, this may be called revealing finder or reveal in file browser. Now the file browser opens and lists the file. I double-click on index.html and it opens in the web browser. Great, it's all there. 
- The title that displays in the browser tab matches the title that I added to the head section and the content is displayed in the browser window but it is still a bit empty. I go back to Visual Studio Code and add a short description for each dish. I do this by adding a paragraph tag below each subheading H2.

SIMPL HTML TAGS:
There are many tags available in HTML. Here you will learn about common tags that you'll use as a developer.
Headings: allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.
Paragraphs: contain text content.
Note: Putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.
Line Breaks: As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.
Strong: Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.
Bold: Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.
Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important.
Emphasis: Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
Italics: Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.
Emphasis vs. Italics: By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. The only difference is the meaning. Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them. Italics represent off-set text and should be used for technical terms, titles, a thought or a phrase from another language. Screen readers will not announce any difference if an italics tag is used.
Lists: You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.
- Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag.
- Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag. Again, list items are specified using the <li> tag.
Div tags: A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS. It can be nested inside other elements. Div elements are an important part of building webpages.
Comments: The comment will not be displayed in the web browser. If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as: <!-- This is a comment -->  


LINKING DOCUMENTS:
- Websites consists of multiple webpages linked together. To link pages together, You use the 'anchor tag'. Anchor tag create hyperlinks(links). 
- In this video, you will learn how to link different web pages together to create your own website. In my project folder. I now create a second webpage for Little Lemon that will contain the address of the restaurants.

Q. You are creating a website and you want to add a link to the about.html page on your home.html page. What is the correct notation to create this link?   
- <a href = “about.html”>About</a> - Correct
- <a> about.html </a>
- <a> href = about.html </a> 
- <a href = “home.html”>About</a>

- I typed the file name, location.html so that my index.html file will link to it. Within a tag I can also add a descriptive text that is displayed as a link name on my web page. So I type our location. The text our location will now display on the web page in the browser as a clickable link. The words are location are displayed in blue by the web browser. If I click on the blue link, the browser opens the location.html file. You can now link different HTML files together to create your website.

ADDING IMAGES TO A WEBPAGE WITH HTML:              
A website without pictures wouldn't provide a very good user experience. 
how to add images to HTML documents using the image (IMG tag). 
- Similar to what I did with document links, I have to specify the link to the image file using the image tag. Images are not inserted into web pages. Instead we use image tags in HTML to link to image files. The image tag then creates a placeholder for the image on the web page. To add an image tag, I type 'img' and inside it I add the 'src' (source) attribute. I type falafel.jpeg As a source for image.
- there are several ways to set the size of an image. Lets see how to do this in HTML. Right after the source in the image tag, you can specify the dimensions of an image. I first add the width attribute, And set it to 240 pixels. Then I add the height attribute and set it to 135 pixels. the images are smaller now. 
- But there is one important attribute that you should always include with image tags. It is good practice to add a short description for images. It helps improve accessibility for people using assistive technologies and it can also improve search engine rankings. You can add image descriptions with the alternative text attribute also known as the 'alt' attribute. Still within the image tag after the dimensions attributes you can add the alt attribute. The alt text is not displayed anywhere on the site but will be read by assistive technologies such as screen readers. Screen readers and other accessibility tools use the alt attribute to provide information to their users.

Q. You want to add an image to your webpage. What should you add within the image tag? Please select all that apply.    
- The width and height specifications - (Correct) - The image will display at its actual size if you do not specify the dimensions in the img tag. The code will be <img src= "example.jpg" width="100" height="100" />
- The alt description - (Correct) - Adding alt descriptions is not required to add an image on your website but it is certainly best practice. This is helpful when the image becomes unavailable, for instance, if the image file is accidentally deleted. But, most importantly, it improves the accessibility of your website to those who are differently abled. Screen readers and other accessibility tools use the Alt attribute to provide information to their users.    
- The link to the source file - (Correct) - Just like when linking to a file, you need to provide the link to the image. The code will be <img src= "example.jpg" width="100" height="100" />
- The href attribute - (InCorrect)

USE HTML TO WORK WITH DATA IN TABLES
The best way to add information like a price list is by using an HTML table. It might be familiar with columns and rows in spreadsheets software. HTML tables look similar and allow you to neatly organize content in rows and columns. Websites almost always have information that needs to be organized in a way that makes it quick and easy to read. 
- I add the 'table' tag(<table>). 
- Inside of it I add to table 'row' tags (<tr> tag). This will create a row for each of the dishes. 
- Now I need to add table data tags(<td> tag) so that I can include the prices. Table data tags define the contents of table cells. So I need to add two of those inside each row, one for the dish and one for its price.
- I'm going to add headers to the columns now. To do this, I add a new row to the top of the table with the table row tag. Then use the table header tag(<th> tag) for the heading cells. I need to add two of those.              

Q. You are developing a website for a shoe shop. In order to add a table to your website, which tags can you use? 
- The table tag: <table> </table> - (Correct) - The table tag is the first tag that you need to insert in order to add a table to a webpage. 
- The table data tags: <td> </td> - (Correct) - You need to add table data tags for each cell in each row.
- The table header tags: <th> </th> - (Correct) - You use the table header tags to add headings to the table which makes it easier to understand the data.
- The table row tag: <tr> </tr> - (Correct) - You need to add table row tags for each line of information in your table. 
- The table column tag: <tc> </tc> - InCorrect




WHAT ARE FORMS?
You can use forms practically every day on the internet.
 - enter your credit card details during checkout. But forms are not limited to e-commerce.  
 - When you log into your favorite website. 

how forms works: when a user enters data on a website an HTML form submits an HTTP request containing the data to the server. 

how to create a form? 
- You define forms with the html form tags(<form></form> tag). 
- Forms also have an optional form attribute called 'action'. 
       - Actions specifies the URL or path that the form should submit the request to. 
       - <form action="/registration" method="POST"> </form>
       - When the 'action' attribute is not specified, it submits the request to the same path as the current web page. 
- There is also the 'FORM method'.
       - with the FORM method you can specify the HTTP method to use for the HTTP request. 
       - There are two HTTP methods to submit the form data, 'GET' and 'POST'. 
       - The GET HTTP method retrieves information from the server. 
       - The POST HTTP method sends data to the server. 
       - When a user submits a form, one of these HTTP methods is used. 

- Text, password, checkbox, radio, textarea, email and number are all types of input. 

how to add fields that the user can enter data into:
- For a simple text field (eg: username). The fields in a form are specified by 'input' tags. 'input' tag does not need a closing tag. But if I want to, I could close the tag by adding a forward slash before the end of the input tag. When I use the text input type, it displays a text field on the web page. 
       TEXT field:
       - <form action="/registration" method="POST"> 
              <input type="text" name="username">
         </form>
- But a text box on its own isn't very user friendly, so I will now add a label above it. By adding the 'label' tag, the form will now display the word 'user name' above the input field. 
       - <form action="/registration" method="POST"> 
              <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
              <input type="text" name="username"/>
         </form>
- For a password field. In this case I won't use the text input type since I don't want the password to be visible. HTML has an input type specific for passwords that will mask the user's input data. The user name will be visible and the password will be masked. 
       - <form action="/registration" method="POST"> 
              <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
              <input type="text" name="username"/>
              <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
              <input type="password"/>
         </form>
- For a button so the user can submit the form. So I used the input type, submit. When the user clicks the submit button, the HTTP request containing the form content will be sent to the web server. In summary, you use the form tag at the start of a form where after you indicate the method that should be used. 
       - <form action="/registration" method="POST"> 
              <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
              <input type="text" name="username"/>
              <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
              <input type="password"/>
              <input type="submit"/>
         </form>
- You can create labels for input types with the label tag, you use the text input type for a text input like a user name. For a password, you use the password input type. To add a submit button to a form, you use the submit input type. 

There are many different input types available. 
- Checkbox: To do this, you use the checkbooks input type. Each box can be checked or unchecked. You use the name and value attributes to configure how the data is sent to the server.
       - <form> 
              <input type="checkbox" name="dog" value="Dog"/>
              <input type="checkbox" name="cat" value="Cat"/>
         </form>
- Radio buttons on the other hand are like checkboxes except only one button can be checked in on the group. Checking one radio button will uncheck all the other radio buttons. 
       - <form> 
              <input type="radio" name="right" value="Right"/>
              <label for="right">I am right handed</label><br>
              <input type="radio" name="left" value="Left"/>
              <label for="left">I am left handed</label><br>
         </form>
- There are also other types of inputs such as 
       - the number, 
       - email and 
       - file upload types. 
              - <form> 
                     <input type="number" name="age" />
                     <input type="email" name="email" />
                     <input type="file" name="file" />
                </form>
- However, some input fields do not use the input tags. For instance the 'multi line' text field. The text input type that I showed you earlier is only for single line text content. To allow users to enter multiple lines of text, I need to use the text area tag instead of text input type. 
       - <form> 
              <textarea name="multiline" rows="5"></textarea>
         </form>
- Another type of input that does not use the input tag is a drop down list which contains items that the user can select. This time, you use the select tag and for the items on the list you use option tags.
       - <form> 
              <select name="food">
                     <option value="chocolate">Chocolate</option>
                     <option value="ice_cream">Ice Cream</option>
              </select>
         </form>
