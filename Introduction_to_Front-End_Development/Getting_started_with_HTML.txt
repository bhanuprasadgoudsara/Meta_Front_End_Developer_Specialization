HTML is text file with specific structure that consists of  different components such as tags and elements and describe to the webpage what to display.

Difference between HTML Tags and HTML Elements:
Each HTML element consists of an opening tag enclosed in angled brackets (Ex: <p>). most elements paired with a closing tag which has a forward slash off to the left angle bracket(Ex: </p>). 

HTML usually have content inside them.
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
       index.html: This is a paragraph 

HTML elements can also contains other elements.
Ex:     HTML synax: 
          <p>
              This is a <i>paragraph</i>
          </p>
        index.html: This is a paragraph(italic)

You want to insert a paragraph on your website. Choose the correct format for the opening and closing paragraph tags:      
- Opening tag: <p/> Closing tag: </p> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p>
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: <p/> 
- Opening tag: <p> Closing tag: </p> - Correct

Elements can also be empty or self-closing (do not have closing HTML tag)
Ex:    HTML synax: <p>This is a <br>paragraph</p> (line break tag)
       index.html: This is a 
                   paragraph  
At the end of self-closing tag, you can close the right angle bracket by '/' like this '<br/>'

HTML standards:
HTML specification: The rules and structure for elements and tags.
The HTML specification is maintained by the "World Wide Web Consortium" (W3C).
Whenever the HTML specification changes, a new version of HTML is standardized.
The current version is 'HTML 5'.
